# Kamome — working memory for Claude Code

**Authoritative spec:** `Docs/kamome-poc-spec.md` (v1.3, 2026-07-15 battery-moat
pivot — phases renumbered: P4 Import & Matching, P5 Passive Tier = v1/TestFlight,
P6 Plans & Fork, P7 backend). Read it before any work.
Rules of Engagement: spec §0 — phase gates are hard gates, no magic numbers
(all tunables in `Config/TrackingConfig.json`), boring tech, demo artifact per
phase, flag anything needing the physical device.

## Current phase: 3 (recap video, spec §4.5/§7) — started 2026-07-16

Gate restructure (decisions.md 2026-07-16, Chiu): the 2 h drive
(`Docs/device-test-P1.md`) and the limited-photo-access re-check moved from
Phase 3 *preconditions* to Phase 3 *gate items* — P3 dev is fixture-driven,
but **P3 cannot close without both**. The 2026-07-16 smoke drive surfaced:

- Road deviation in the polyline is expected (sparse drive sampling + ε=15 m
  display simplification); fix is OSRM matching (§4.4, P3 stretch / P4 core),
  raw points are retained — do NOT tighten sampling config for this.
- **P3 work item:** phantom-trip guard — `TrackingSession.end()` saves even a
  2-second zero-point trip (degenerate input for §4.5 camera path). Min
  duration/distance thresholds go in `Config/TrackingConfig.json`.
- Photo fixes landed 2026-07-16: route-attached photos (stop_id NULL) get an
  S3 strip; Selected-Photos access shows a banner + limited-library picker;
  re-match preserves highlights. Limited-access box stays unticked until Chiu
  re-checks on device.
- Evening dwell_pause without dwell_resume was benign (parked until End
  Trip) — region-resume still unproven on hardware; the drive proves it.

## Verification commands (run from repo root)

```bash
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme Kamome test -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
swiftlint
```

(Local Xcode is 26.6 → destination iPhone 17 Pro; CI auto-picks its simulator.
swiftlint locally needs `XCODE_DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_OVERRIDE=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
— Rosetta swiftlint can't load Xcode 26's arm64-only SourceKit.)

The `.xcodeproj` is generated — never hand-edit it; change `project.yml` and
re-run `xcodegen generate`.
