# `stop_weighting_enabled` — reachable in both modes, containment only empirical

The removal criterion, decided in advance (Chiu 2026-08-07) so it is not
re-litigated. A removal PR must not cite "provably contained".

## `stop_weighting_enabled` — reachable in BOTH modes, containment only empirical

**Corrected 2026-08-07.** An earlier note in this file claimed it was "unreachable
by construction" under `.highlight`. **That was wrong**, and the error was
overclaiming a structural property from two datasets. Chiu asked for the verdict
to be split per mode, which is what exposed it. Classified separately, both
answers are *empirical*, and neither is safe to rely on for a removal PR.

### Under `.highlight` — NOT dead by construction. Empirically zero on big trips only.

Tiering keeps the top `keptStopCount` stops by score, and `StopWeighting` demotes
stops with ≤ `waypoint_max_photos` (2) *and* a short dwell. Those sets are disjoint
**only while the trip has more stops than the film can keep** — because then only
heavily-photographed stops survive the cut.

**When a trip has fewer stops than the budget keeps, every stop survives, including
two-photo ones, and `StopWeighting` fires.** Measured at a 120 s film
(`keptStopCount` = 11):

| fixture | stops | waypoints under `.highlight` + weighting |
|---|---:|---:|
| Iceland | 65 | 0 |
| New Zealand | 20 | 0 |
| **Margaret River** | **4** | **1** ← fires |
| Finland | 3 | 0 |

So the "0 waypoints" result on Iceland and NZ is a consequence of those trips being
*large*, not of the filters being mutually exclusive. A short trip reaches it.

### Under `.full` — non-dead, and the containment is empirical too.

It fires: 8 of 65 on Iceland, 1 of 20 on NZ. The claim that its targets are always
inside the allocator's bottom-`allocation_zero_share` (40%) zeroing is **not
structural**: the allocator ranks by *relative* score, so whether a two-photograph
stop lands in the bottom 40% depends on the distribution of the rest of the trip.
On a trip where most stops carry two photographs, a two-photograph stop can rank
well above the 40th percentile and be given photos by the allocator that
`StopWeighting` then strips.

Iceland and New Zealand both have long, heavily-skewed tails (2 → 252 photographs),
which is exactly the shape that makes containment hold. **It has not been shown to
hold on a flat distribution, and no such trip has been tested.**

### What this means before running `.full` on new data

Chiu intends to use `.full`. Margaret River, Miyakojima and the WA trip have **not**
been measured under it. `StopWeighting` applies *after* the mode in
`RecapComposer`, so it can strip photographs the allocator granted — the mechanism
is live, not theoretical.

### The removal criterion (Chiu 2026-08-07) — decided in advance so it is not re-litigated

Two **separate** questions, to be measured separately on Margaret River,
Miyakojima and the WA trip under `.full`:

1. **Structural eligibility** — does `stop_count <= keptStopCount` reliably predict
   when `StopWeighting` fires? This is the technical question above: *can* the code
   path execute, and is there a rule that says when.
2. **Perceptual impact** — when it *does* fire, is the rendered film perceptibly
   different? Render both ways and compare the actual output, not the stop table.

They are complementary, not alternatives. A path can be technically live and
visually irrelevant.

**The criterion: if question 2 comes back "not distinguishable" consistently across
all three trips, that is grounds to remove the feature outright — regardless of
whether the code path still technically executes.** A live-but-invisible branch is
not a reason to keep configuration surface.

Conversely, a single trip where the film is visibly different keeps it, and the
answer to question 1 then decides whether the trigger needs to become structural
rather than incidental.

**A removal PR must not cite "provably contained".** It must either measure the new
datasets, or make the containment structural (e.g. run the classifier *before*
allocation, or fold its threshold into the allocator's scoring).

**Not removed** (Chiu 2026-08-07): timing and review scope, decided separately after
the `RecapMode` migration lands and passes CI.
